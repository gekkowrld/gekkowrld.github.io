# Hello to You :wave: visitor

## Introduction

My name is Gordon, I'm currently learning web development.

This is my website[^1].  
It is a slow process to building this and I really don't know if it'll ever end[^2].

[^1]: The languages used are currently html, css and javascript. There are no technologies used! Its currently under construction[^a].
[^a]: I couldn't find a better word for construction.
[^2]: This is slow because I'm learning many concepts and I really don't know what to put up and what not to. But if you want to see other project, check my public github repositories.
